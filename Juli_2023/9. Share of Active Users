9. Share of Active Users

Output share of US users that are active. Active users are the ones with an "open" status in the table.

DataFrame: fb_active_users
Expected Output Type: pandas.DataFrame

# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
fb_active_users.head()
df = fb_active_users.copy()
df.head()

# filter condition country and open
df_filter = df[df['country'] == 'USA']

# count df open
df_filter_open = df_filter[df_filter['status'] == 'open']

# count of open
open_df = df_filter_open.groupby(['status']).size().sum()
# count all status
all_df = df_filter.groupby(['status']).size().sum()

# open / all
df['open'] = open_df / all_df
