Bikes Last Used

Find the last time each bike was in use. Output both the bike number and the date-timestamp of the bike's last use (i.e., the date-time the bike was returned). 
Order the results by bikes that were most recently used.

DataFrame: dc_bikeshare_q1_2012
Expected Output Type: pandas.DataFrame

# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# Start writing code
dc_bikeshare_q1_2012.head()
df = dc_bikeshare_q1_2012.copy()
df.head()

# group by
df_g = df.groupby(['bike_number','end_time']).size().reset_index()

# group by max
df_ge = df_g.groupby(['bike_number']).agg({'end_time' : 'max'}).reset_index()
df_ge.drop_duplicates()
